**** JavaScript ****

1. How to accept user input?
--> Its has two way,
    1. By using windows prompt 
	--> eg. let username = window.prompt("Enter your username");
	
	2. By using html textbox
	--> let username;
        document.getElementById("mybutton").onclick = function(){
          username = document.getElementById("mytext").value;
          document.getElementById("myH").textContent = `welcome, ${username}`;
        }
	
2. Data type conversion
--> Integer <--> String <--> Boolen
    eg. let x = "ABC";
	    x = Number(x);  --> Console.log(x , typeOf x)  --> NaN number   --- (NaN i.e Not a Number)
		x = String(x);  --> Console.log(x , typeOf x)  --> ABC String
		x = Boolen(x);  --> Console.log(x , typeOf x)  --> true boolen  
		
	--> We can convert any datatype to boolen, then its give true.
	--> If we convert empty string to boolen then its give false.
	--> If we doesn`t assign value to the variable and we want to convert into the boolen then its give false.
	
3. let & const variable 
--> let x = 1234;   --> we can futher change the valude of x in the program 
    const PI = 3.14159;  --> we can not change the value of PI one we declear and assign value. 
							 Generally  const variable we can declear in uppercase.
	
4. Math. fucnctions
--> it is use for doing the math operation, like max(), min(), random(), floor(), etc.

5. Generate the random number.
--> By using Math.random() function we can genarate random number.
    eg. let random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1
		--> here Math.random() function gives output of random number in floting points and grater then and equal to 0 and less then one.
		--> so here Math.floor function is converting the floting point number to Integer.
		--> here (.... * 6 ) means I want random number in between 0 to 6, But equal to 0 
		--> and (....) + 1 means I want 0 to 6 i.e. 0 also and 6 also for that I need to add +1.
		
6. .checked properties
--> it is use to checkes wether the any checkedboc or any button like radio button is checked or not.

7. ternary operator
--> Its just like a if..else statement.
    --> syntax --  condition ? true : false
	--> eg. age >= 18 ? "Your age is 18+" : "Your are still 18-";
	
8. String Methods
--> There are some pre define methods for string manupilation like length, toUppercas(), indexOf(), lastIndexof(), etc
--> Some Methods --
    --> length --> gives the length of string
	--> indexOf("A") --> give the index of A 
	--> firstIndexOf("A") --> gives the first apperance of A
	--> lastIndesOf("A")  --> give last apperanceof A
	--> padStart(15 , "0") --> its make string length of 15, and if its not 15 then add 0 at start position to make length 15.
	--> padLast(15 , "0")  --> its make string length of 15, and if its not 15 then add 0 at last position to make length 15.
	--> slice(start , end) --> its give sub string according to the index
	
9. I have a string of full name, so i want to seprate both first and last name
--> eg. let fullName = "Ritesh Sherekar"
        I want --> firstName = Ritesh , lastName = Sherekar
		
	--> let firstName = fullName.slice(0 , fullName.indexOf(" ")); -- Ritesh --  // Its give char from 0 index to index of space 
	--> let lastName = fullName.slice(fullName.indexOf(" ") + 1); -- Sherekar -- // Its give char from index of index of space to length of fullName
	
10. Method Chaining 
--> Its is use to write a string methods in one line
    eg. let username = fullName.trim().charAt(0).toUpperCase() + fullName.trim().slice(1).toLowerCase();
